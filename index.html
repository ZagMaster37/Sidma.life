        We are Sidmas, but was does that mean? A sidma is someone who shows
        unwavering support to the Tsar and someone who actively takes part in
        the Sidma community. We boast a large diverity in our Sidma members;
        from Anish born in British Raj to Obi born in El Rancherito, we have it
        all! As Sidmas we worship Chris, the god of low intelect, as well as
        many other holy beings you will learn about in your Sidma Bible Study
        (Comming Soon). To qualify as a Sidma you need to pass the Sidma
        citizenship test, sit at the Sidma table atleast once and be a member of
        The Sid Chamber. As a Sidma you get benefits you could only dream of.
        Fully belly twice a day, clean straw to roll apon, answers to all
        homework from every class, news on current real-world events and free
        healthcare (Comes at tax increase). Being a Sidma is more than just a
        religion, it's a lifestyle. From mandatory involment in Game Night to a
        free PB every lunch, the Sidma nation gives it's people more benefits
        than any other nation in the world.
