        <h3>Ancient History</h3>
        <p>
          The first evidence of Sidma life dates back to March 22nd, 2022.
          Historians believe this is when the first "Busting" occurred. Busting
          is a accicent and holy tradition among Sidmas that happens at lunch
          when a lunch milk carton gets wet because it was punished to much.
          After the Milk starts dripping, a chossen Sidma will open the carton
          and begin drinking. It is at this time that the rest of the Sidmas
          will try to make the drinker of the milk laugh, and subsequently bust
          out with hardy chuckles. Because of this tradition the first Sidmas
          labeled themselves as "Busters". The impact of this era can still be
          found today. The phrase "Thy Busters" has staying in common dielect
          throughout the ages. Busting is still a common sight to see at lunch
          after the meals are finished.

      <div id="Ice Age">
        <h3>Ice age</h3>
        <p>
          After the emergence of the first Sidmas, there was a ice age (Late
          spring to early fall 2023). During this time pop culture trends slowed
          down and many busters 'came' and went. Some of these people inculde
          Sam, Collin and Obi. There some societal progress in this time, such
          as Leo and Charlie becoming busters and the intoduction of early
          running jokes among Sidmas such as Mrs Coonrod, Racial Leo and the
          origin of Chris Turner being called sid, coined by Eli Carlson.
          Besides this it was a lot of 9/11 and communism jokes as well as a
          turf war with the mexicans bordering us.

        <h3>Renaissance</h3>
        <p>
          This was a time of great innovation in the Sidma world the likes of
          which had never been seen. The name "Buster" became less commonplace
          and was slowly replaced with the modern term Sidma, a combonation of
          Sid and Sigma, thought of by Tsar Ali himself. Other progessive ideas
          inculde Tsar Ali's beef with Isaac Gosteli, Abtrusive Mire, Pepper AI,
          the over sexualization of women, thy pepeogger, The Creation of Sid
          Chamber and the failed anti-sidma rebelion, the inclusion of Isaac
          as a Sidma, Geoguessr, the now common phrase "Leo Brain" and much
          more. Much of the cultural revolution of this time can still be seen
          today.

        <h3>Modern Era</h3>
        <p>
          That brings us to modern day (2024 - present). While much has stayed
          the same since the renaissance, there have been minor additions to the
          lore. There have been satirical jokes made that the Tsar has feelings
          for Cece due to her witnessing the Tsar bravely extinguish the fire
          that Sam had started with his evil intensions. The rumors have been
          proven false. Besides that the Tsar has been facing troubles with the
          public having fantasies about his royal family. The Tsar does not like
          this. The modern era has also brought about a constant problem that is
          game night. What is supposed to be a fun friday night were Sidmas can
          play games has been deserted because of a lack of players. The Tsar
          will fix this, we just have to work harder.
